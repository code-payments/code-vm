The Code Virtual Machine (Code VM) is a program that runs on the Solana
blockchain. It is purpose built for payments and reduces transaction fees by up
to `95%` and account rent by `80%` when compared to using non-virtualized
accounts. Additionally, the Code VM can compress dormant accounts off-chain,
reducing account rent to effectively `zero`.  Compressed accounts can be
decompressed when needed â€” either automatically using the Code app or manually
through a public indexer. 

The Code VM is designed to be used by the Code app, to deliver a seamless
payments experience to millions of users at negligible cost.

##  What is Code?

[Code](https://getcode.com) is a mobile app that leverages self custodial 
blockchain technology to deliver a seamless payments experience that is instant, 
global, and private.
