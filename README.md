The Code Virtual Machine (Code VM) is a program that runs on the Solana
blockchain. It is purpose built for payments and reduces transaction fees by up
to `95%` and account rent by `80%` when compared to using non-virtualized
accounts. The VM operates on compact representations of accounts but can further 
compress dormant accounts off-chain, effectively reducing rent to `zero`. 
Compressed accounts can be decompressed when needed â€” either automatically 
using the Code app or manually through a public indexer.

The Code VM is designed to be used by the Code app, to deliver a seamless
payments experience to millions of users at negligible cost.

##  What is Code?

[Code](https://getcode.com) is a mobile app that leverages self custodial 
blockchain technology to deliver a seamless payments experience that is instant, 
global, and private.
